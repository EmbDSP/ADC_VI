# Analog-to-Digital Conversion Assisted by Virtual Experiments

The VI proposed was developed in LabVIEW and is provided to students as an executable software.

The user can choose between two menus: "Configure" and "View" in the upper left corner of this window. The signal to be sampled and the ADC characteristics are specified in the "Configure" menu. 

The "Function Generator" panel presents resources similar to a real instrument and allows students to choose the signal type as well as its basic features, such as frequency, amplitude, offset, and noise. 

The "Analog-to-Digital Converter" panel allows students to set the ADC parameters, such as: resolution, sampling rate, full scale voltage range, offset, and gain errors. 

The AD conversion can be analyzed by two resources located in the "View" menu: "Histogram" and "Transfer Curve".
